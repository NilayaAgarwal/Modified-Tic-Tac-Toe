# MODIFIED TIC-TAC-TOE

A modified and more strategic version of classic game Tic-Tac-Toe:smile:. 

Mode: 2 players

## Rules

There are 3 boards initially. Both players, turn by turn, make a 'X' mark on any unfilled cell of any board.

Whenever a line is formed (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) on a particular board, that board is removed from playing area and the game continues in the remaining boards.

When only one board remains,and a player makes a line on that board, he LOSES.
